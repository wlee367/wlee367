### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Jason, I'm a full stack developer living in Ontario, Canada. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with a [venture studio](http://www.eighty8.co) in London, Ontario partnering with startups and building out tech products for them primarily using React, Sass, Laravel, Doctrine, Docker, and MySql. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript and mobile app development with React Native, Swift / Objective C and Kotlin.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Laravel, MySQL, and other knickknacks you want an answer to. 

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me via [email](mailto:proto.rhee@gmail.com)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

## Programming Languages and Tools I work with outside of work

##### :computer: Frontend Development:
HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (EcmaScript 2016+), React.JS, Next.JS, After.JS, Redux.JS (Thunk, Sagas), Styled Components, and TypeScript

##### :wrench: Backend Development:
Java, Python,  NestJS, NodeJS, Laravel (PHP 7+), GraphQL, MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgresSQL. 

##### :iphone: Mobile Development:
React Native, Swift, Kotlin

###### That was a lot of languages and tools I just listed. 

I am a problem solver more than a "programmer". I like solving everyday problems with code. I learn on my feet, make adjustments, and help people and businesses reach their goals and build solutions. 

When I solve problems, I try to build a solution that is tested, reusable, and easy for other programmers to use, all the while meeting deadlines and communicating with my teammates. 

If that sounds appealing to you, read on to get in touch with me. 

___I am currently looking for employment opportunities to take my career to the next level.___
